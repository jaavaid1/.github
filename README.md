## 4. Essential Skills to Tackle AI Challenges

To work effectively with AI in the future, journalists must acquire new skills.

### (a) Data Analysis

Journalists must develop the ability to analyze data and transform it into news, requiring extensive research, study, and practice.

### (b) Use of AI Tools

Journalists should train in AI tools such as **NLP, data visualization,** and **automated journalism software**.

### (c) Critical Thinking

The ability to verify and critically analyze AI-generated news will be crucial for journalists.

### (d) Ethics and Privacy

Understanding ethical and privacy principles in AI usage will be essential for journalists.
